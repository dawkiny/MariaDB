The 4399OS_02_01.sql file is meant to be copied and pasted into the mysql 
command-line client.


In contrast, the 4399OS_06_01.sql, 4399OS_09_documents.sql, and 
hs_sample_data.sql files can either be copied and pasted into the mysql 
command-line client or they can be imported into MariaDB directly on the 
command line like so:


mysql -u username -p < 4399OS_06_01.sql


Replace 'username' with a valid user name and provide the appropriate password
 when prompted.
